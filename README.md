TempMon
=======
Some quick scripting to help deal with running Ubuntu linux on a Mac Mini where the fan control is fubarred out of the box.  Requires the applesmc kernel module
to be activated and lm-sensors installed. Uses the `sensors` command. http://lm-sensors.org/wiki/man/sensors. 

There are other solutions available that are probably more widely used, tested and supported.

This is a problem with "old" hardware and I chose to hack together a fix myself. Use this software at your own risk.

These scripts can be used to directly set the fan speed by writing values to the /sys fs.

TempMon2.rb
-----------
I run this via cron to check the various temprature sensors, squirt the temp readings into graphite, and if the temp passes certain thressholds, spin the fan
faster or slower.  

Tempmon.rb
----------
Earlier simpler version of TempMon2.rb

This is what I get back from sensors and informed how I approached parsing.
